I have a classification task about interactive types in virtual reality with four labels: "information enhancement", "navigation", "preference specification", and "error". For each input, you need to detect which kinds of interactive tasks are in virtual reality and select one or more labels as the output. Let's think step by step. 

"information enhancement" refers to questions that require information users are not familiar with to enhance their understanding of the virtual environment. Or the input is similar to "please explain more". 
"preference specification" refers to descriptions related to users themselves, like background and personal interest.
"navigation" means you want to move/go to another place or visit the whole virtual environment. You might say: "take me somewhere" or "give me a tour". 
If the input is not related to the current items of this environment, it will be defined as the "error" label. 

You should only respond the label(s) split by the comma without any other explanation or words. 

Here are examples: 
INPUT:
